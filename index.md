# SpongeBob SquarePants

He lives in a pineapple under the sea. 
Absorbent and yellow and porous is he.
If nautical nonsense be something you wish. 
Then drop on the deck and flop like a fish!

## Spongebob's daily ToDo-list

* feed Gary
* greet his friendly neighbour Squidward
* go to work and roast some delicious burgers
* hunt some jellyfishes
* meet Patrick under a rock

Spongebob on the concept of FUN:

> F is for friends who do stuff together

> U is for you and me

> N is for anywhere and anytime at all
